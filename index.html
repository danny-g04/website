                    About me
                </h2>
                <p> Here at the University, I am the president of the Table Tennis Club. I joined the club during my freshman year and worked my way up, becoming the president during my junior year. Other than Table Tennis, I love my cat, his name is Aster. My sister got him back in 2018, so we've had him for a few years now. He lives back at home with my parents, but I miss him everyday. Here is a picture of him.   </p>
